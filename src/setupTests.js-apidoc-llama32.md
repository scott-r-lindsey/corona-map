**setupTests.js**
================

**File Overview**
---------------

This file serves as a setup script for Jest testing framework. It imports necessary dependencies and configures Jest with custom matchers from `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

**Importing Dependencies**
-------------------------

The following line imports the `extend-expect` function from `@testing-library/jest-dom`, which adds custom Jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.

```javascript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
```

**Custom Matchers**
-----------------

The `extend-expect` function allows you to add custom matchers for asserting on DOM nodes. These matchers provide a more intuitive way of interacting with the DOM in your tests.

For example, with this import, you can use the following matcher:

```javascript
expect(element).toHaveTextContent(/react/i);
```

This matcher checks if the text content of an HTML element contains the substring "react" (case-insensitive).

**Key Logic**
-------------

The key logic in this file is to configure Jest with the custom matchers from `@testing-library/jest-dom`. This allows you to use these matchers in your tests, making it easier to write assertions about DOM nodes.

By importing and extending Jest with custom matchers, you can write more concise and readable tests that focus on the behavior of your application rather than the implementation details of the DOM.

**Conclusion**
----------

The `setupTests.js` file provides a simple yet effective way to configure Jest with custom matchers from `@testing-library/jest-dom`. This allows developers to write more intuitive and readable tests for their web applications.
