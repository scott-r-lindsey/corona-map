### File Overview

The file `/var/www/html/scott/corona-map/src/App.test.jsx` contains unit tests for the `App` component. It uses several testing libraries such as `@testing-library/react`, `sinon`, and `jest` to mock HTTP requests, handle routing, and simulate browser media queries.

### Imports

- **React**: The main React library.
- **render**: A function from `@testing-library/react` used to render React components for testing.
- **MemoryRouter**: A router component from `react-router-dom` that keeps the history of your “URL” in memory (does not read or write to the address bar).
- **sinon**: A library for creating spies, mocks, and stubs in tests.
- **mediaQuery**: A helper from `css-mediaquery` to match CSS media queries.
- **App**: The main application component being tested.
- **appData**: Mock data imported from a fixture JSON file.
- **mapData**: Mock data imported from a JSON file representing a map of states.

### Jest Mock

- **jest.mock('node-fetch')**: This mocks the `node-fetch` library with `fetch-mock-jest` to handle HTTP requests in tests.

### Constants

- **appDataUrl**: The URL from which the application fetches its data.
- **mapDataUrl**: The URL from which the application fetches map data.
- **url**: A specific route used during testing.

### Helpers

1. **createMatchMedia**:
    - A factory function that creates a `matchMedia` object for simulating media queries.
    - `width`: The width to match against in the media query.
    - Returns an object with properties `matches`, `addListener`, and `removeListener`.

2. **renderWithRouter**:
    - A helper function to render a component wrapped with `MemoryRouter` for handling in-memory routing during tests.
    - `component`: The React component to render.

### Test Suite: `App.js`

#### Variables

- **server**: A fake server created using `sinon` to handle HTTP requests.

#### Lifecycle Methods

1. **beforeAll**:
    - Sets up the `matchMedia` API to simulate a screen width of 1600 pixels before running any tests.

2. **beforeEach**:
    - Initializes a fake server to respond to HTTP requests.
    - Sets up the server to respond with `mapData` when the `mapDataUrl` is requested.
    - Configures `fetchMock` to return `appData` for a single GET request to `appDataUrl`.

3. **afterEach**:
    - Restores the original server state.
    - Resets and restores `fetchMock` to its initial state.

#### Test Cases

1. **it('Loads json data and renders')**:
    - A test case to ensure the application loads JSON data and renders correctly.
    - Uses `act` from `react-dom/test-utils` to ensure all updates related to the render are processed.
    - Checks:
        - If the `appDataUrl` was fetched.
        - If the server received one request and the URL matches `mapDataUrl`.
        - If the rendered DOM contains specific text indicating the component rendered as expected.

2. **test('nothing does nothing')**:
    - A simple trivial test case to verify that `true` is truthy, ensuring the test suite runs correctly.

### Code Summary

The file sets up the environment to test the `App` component by simulating network requests and media query results. It ensures the component fetches data correctly and renders expected output. The tests are organized with lifecycle methods to initialize and clean up the environment before and after each test.
