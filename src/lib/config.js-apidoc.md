# File: /var/www/html/scott/corona-map/src/config.js

This file is a configuration module for a web application dealing with COVID-19 data visualization. It exports constants that are used throughout the application to maintain consistency and ease of configuration.

## Exported Constants

### 1. `home`

```javascript
export const home = '/COVID-US/now/confirmed/total/united%20states';
```

- **Type**: `String`
- **Description**: This constant defines the default URL path that represents the home or main view of the application. This URL path is typically used to navigate to the initial state of the application, which in this case, appears to be showing the total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States.
- **Usage**: 
  - This constant can be imported into other parts of the application where a redirection to the home view is needed.
  - It ensures that the home path is consistent across the application by centralizing its definition.

### 2. `foo`

```javascript
export const foo = 'foo';
```

- **Type**: `String`
- **Description**: This constant is a placeholder with a value of `'foo'`. It may be intended for testing purposes or as a stub for future development.
- **Usage**:
  - This constant can be imported into other parts of the application, although its current usage is not specified and likely serves as a simple placeholder.
  - It can be replaced or repurposed as needed in the future development of the application.

## Summary

This configuration file is minimal but crucial in maintaining key constants that are used throughout the web application. By defining these constants in a centralized module, the application can ensure consistency and simplify future updates to these values. The specific constants defined in this file are:

1. **`home`**: Represents the main view URL path for the COVID-19 data visualization application.
2. **`foo`**: A placeholder constant, potentially for testing or future use.

The use of `export` ensures that these constants can be easily imported and utilized in other parts of the application.
