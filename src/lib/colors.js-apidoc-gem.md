# File Documentation: `colors.js`

## Overview

The `colors.js` file is a JavaScript module located in the `/var/www/html/scott/corona-map/src/` directory. This module defines a set of color constants that are used throughout a web application for styling purposes. The constants are categorized based on their usage in the application. These categories include primary and secondary theme colors, map-related colors, shared colors for common data representations, and colors specific to a logarithmic chart visualization. 

## Exported Constants

### Theme Colors

- **`primary`**: 
  - **Value**: `'#424242'`
  - **Description**: This constant defines the primary color used in the application's theme. The color is a shade of dark gray and is likely used for major elements such as backgrounds, headers, or primary text.

- **`secondary`**: 
  - **Value**: `'#FF5722'`
  - **Description**: This constant represents the secondary color in the applicationâ€™s theme. The color is a vibrant orange, which can be used for accents, highlights, or buttons to draw attention.

### Map Colors

These constants are specifically used for coloring elements on a map visualization.

- **`zeroColor`**: 
  - **Value**: `'#AAA67A'`
  - **Description**: This color is used to represent areas on a map with zero or minimal data (e.g., zero cases). It is a muted gray-yellow color, providing a neutral visual appearance.

- **`minColor`**: 
  - **Value**: `'#FFF700'`
  - **Description**: This bright yellow color is used for mapping areas with minimal data values above zero. It may represent lower thresholds of data, such as a low number of COVID-19 cases.

- **`maxColor`**: 
  - **Value**: `'#A70024'`
  - **Description**: A deep red color used to indicate areas with the maximum data values, such as high numbers of cases. It is used to draw attention to critical regions on the map.

### Shared Colors

These colors are used in various parts of the application for representing specific data points related to COVID-19.

- **`confirmedColor`**: 
  - **Value**: `'#DD9850'`
  - **Description**: This color is used to represent confirmed cases of COVID-19. It is an orange-brown color, providing a distinct visual cue.

- **`deathColor`**: 
  - **Value**: `'#D12715'`
  - **Description**: This color is used to represent death cases related to COVID-19. It is a stark red color, providing a strong visual signal for critical data.

### Log Chart Colors

These constants are used specifically for styling elements in logarithmic charts, which might be used to visualize COVID-19 trends over time.

- **`logColor`**: 
  - **Value**: `'#222222'`
  - **Description**: A very dark gray color used as the primary background or line color in log charts, providing a contrasting backdrop for data visualization.

- **`logLabelColor`**: 
  - **Value**: `'#aaaaaa'`
  - **Description**: A light gray color used for labels and annotations on log charts. It ensures readability against the dark background of the chart.

## Usage

These constants provide a centralized way to manage color schemes across the application, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance. By using named constants instead of hard-coded color values in the application, developers can easily update the color scheme by changing the values in this single file.
