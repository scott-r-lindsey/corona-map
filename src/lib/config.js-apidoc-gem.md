# File: config.js

This file serves as a configuration module for the application, providing specific constants that can be used throughout the codebase. Its primary function is to export key configuration settings that define specific paths or identifiers used in the application. It is implemented using ES6 module syntax.

## Exported Constants

### 1. `home`

- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: This constant represents a specific endpoint or path within the application. It is a URL-encoded string that likely points to a resource or page related to COVID-19 statistics for the United States.
- **Value**: `'/COVID-US/now/confirmed/total/united%20states'`
  - **Breakdown**:
    - `COVID-US`: This suggests the path is related to COVID-19 data specific to the United States.
    - `now`: This might indicate that the data is current or a snapshot of live information.
    - `confirmed`: This likely refers to confirmed cases of COVID-19.
    - `total`: Implies that the data is aggregated, possibly a total count.
    - `united%20states`: A URL-encoded version of "united states," specifying the geographical focus of the data.

### 2. `foo`

- **Type**: `string`
- **Description**: This constant appears to be a placeholder or an example configuration entry. The name `foo` is commonly used in programming as a temporary or example variable name when demonstrating concepts without focusing on specific data.
- **Value**: `'foo'`
  - This value does not have a specific meaning within the context of this file, suggesting it might be used for testing, illustrative purposes, or to be replaced with actual configuration data in the future.

## Usage

These constants are meant to be imported into other parts of the application where these specific configuration settings are needed. By centralizing these values in a configuration file, the application can maintain consistency and make future changes more manageable.

## Example

To use these constants in another module, you would import them as follows:

```javascript
import { home, foo } from './config.js';

// Example usage
console.log(home); // Outputs: /COVID-US/now/confirmed/total/united%20states
console.log(foo);  // Outputs: foo
```

## Key Points

- **Modularity**: The use of ES6 module exports allows for clean and manageable code, enabling these constants to be easily reused across different modules.
- **Maintainability**: By defining key configuration paths in a single location, updates to these paths require changes in just this file, rather than in multiple places throughout the codebase.
- **Placeholder Usage**: The `foo` constant signifies that developers might use this file as a template or starting point for more complex configurations.

This file is a simple yet effective way to manage configuration data within a JavaScript application, especially in projects that require constant paths or identifiers for API endpoints or resource locations.
