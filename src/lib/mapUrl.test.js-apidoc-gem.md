# Documentation for `/var/www/html/scott/corona-map/src/mapUrl.test.js`

This file contains unit tests for the `updateUrl` function, which is assumed to be defined in the `mapUrl.js` file. The purpose of these tests is to verify that the `updateUrl` function correctly updates portions of a URL based on given parameters.

## Import Statements

- **`import updateUrl from './mapUrl';`**: This line imports the `updateUrl` function from the `mapUrl.js` module, which is located in the same directory as this test file. The `updateUrl` function is the subject of the tests defined in this file.

## Test Suite

The entire set of tests is contained within a `describe` block:

- **`describe('updateUrl', () => { ... });`**: This function groups together related tests for the `updateUrl` function. The string 'updateUrl' is a description of the test suite, which helps in identifying the test output related to this function.

### Base Object

Within the `describe` block, there is a constant object defined:

- **`const base = { ... };`**: This object represents the base state or default parameters for generating a URL. It contains the following key-value pairs:
  - `mode: 'COVID-US'`: Represents the mode of the data, initially set to 'COVID-US'.
  - `when: 'now'`: Indicates the time frame for the data, set to 'now'.
  - `axis: 'confirmed'`: Specifies the data axis, initially set to 'confirmed'.
  - `quant: 'total'`: Represents the quantity metric, set to 'total'.
  - `location: 'united states'`: Represents the geographic location, set to 'united states'.

This `base` object is used as the initial state for the URLs in the tests.

## Individual Tests

### Test 1: Updating the Mode

- **`it('updates the mode', () => { ... });`**: This test case verifies that the `mode` parameter can be successfully updated in the URL.
  - **`const url = updateUrl(base, { mode: 'COVID-COUNTY' });`**: Calls the `updateUrl` function with the `base` object and a new `mode` value 'COVID-COUNTY'. The result is stored in the `url` variable.
  - **`expect(url).toEqual('/COVID-COUNTY/now/confirmed/total/united states');`**: Asserts that the `url` is correctly updated to reflect the new `mode`, expecting the URL to be '/COVID-COUNTY/now/confirmed/total/united states'.

### Test 2: Updating the Location

- **`it('updates the location', () => { ... });`**: This test case ensures that the `location` parameter can be successfully updated in the URL.
  - **`const url = updateUrl(base, { location: 'foobar' });`**: Calls the `updateUrl` function with the `base` object and a new `location` value 'foobar'. The result is stored in the `url` variable.
  - **`expect(url).toEqual('/COVID-US/now/confirmed/total/foobar');`**: Asserts that the `url` is correctly updated to reflect the new `location`, expecting the URL to be '/COVID-US/now/confirmed/total/foobar'.

## Summary

This test file validates the functionality of the `updateUrl` function by ensuring it can correctly modify specific parts of a URL based on changes to particular parameters. The two tests cover changes to `mode` and `location`, confirming that the generated URLs reflect these updates accurately. The `describe` and `it` functions are part of the Jest testing framework, which provides a readable and structured way to define test suites and individual test cases.
