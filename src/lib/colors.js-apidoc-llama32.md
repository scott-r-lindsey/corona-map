### Colors

The following colors are defined in this file:

#### Primary Colors

*   `primary`: A dark gray color represented by the hexadecimal code `#424242`.
    *   This color is used as the primary background color for the Corona Map application.
*   `secondary`: An orange color represented by the hexadecimal code `#FF5722`.
    *   This color is used to represent secondary data points, such as confirmed cases and deaths.

#### Map Colors

*   `zeroColor`: A light brown color represented by the hexadecimal code `#AAA67A`.
    *   This color is used to represent areas with zero reported cases.
*   `minColor`: An orange-yellow color represented by the hexadecimal code `#FFF700`.
    *   This color is used to represent areas with low reported cases.
*   `maxColor`: A red-brown color represented by the hexadecimal code `#A70024`.
    *   This color is used to represent areas with high reported cases.

#### Shared Colors

*   `confirmedColor`: An orange color represented by the hexadecimal code `#DD9850`.

### Key Logic

The colors defined in this file are used throughout the Corona Map application to represent different types of data. By using a consistent set of colors, the application can easily communicate its visual representation scheme to users and developers alike.

```javascript
// Import the colors.js file
import { primary, secondary } from './colors';

// Use the colors in your application
console.log(primary); // Output: #424242

console.log(secondary); // Output: #FF5722
```

### Usage

To use these colors in your application, simply import the `colors` object and access the desired color constants. For example:

```javascript
import { primary, secondary } from './colors';

const backgroundColor = primary;
const confirmedColor = secondary;

// Use these colors in your HTML or CSS
background-color: ${backgroundColor};
confirmed-color: ${confirmedColor};
```
