# Documentation for `mapUrl.js`

This JavaScript module contains a single function, `updateUrl`, which is responsible for constructing a URL path based on a set of parameters. This can be particularly useful in web applications where dynamic URL generation is required based on user preferences or application state changes.

## Function: `updateUrl`

### Purpose
The `updateUrl` function generates a URL path string by merging two sets of parameters: an existing set (`current`) and a set of desired changes (`changes`). This allows for the dynamic updating of a URL path without manually reconstructing the entire URL string.

### Parameters
- `current` (Object): An object representing the current state of parameters. This object should include keys that correspond to parts of the URL such as `mode`, `when`, `axis`, `quant`, and `location`.
- `changes` (Object): An object representing the changes to be applied to the `current` parameters. This object may contain any subset of the keys included in `current`.

### Logic
1. **Merge Parameters**: The function begins by merging the `current` and `changes` objects using the spread operator. This operation creates a new `update` object which includes all properties from `current` but overrides them with any properties found in `changes`. This ensures that any changes provided are applied to the resulting URL parameters.

2. **Destructure Updated Parameters**: The function destructures the `update` object to extract specific properties: `mode`, `when`, `axis`, `quant`, and `location`. These properties represent the segments of the URL path.

3. **Construct URL Path**: The function returns a string that represents a URL path. This path is constructed by combining the destructured properties into a slash-separated format: `/${mode}/${when}/${axis}/${quant}/${location}`. This format assumes a URL structure common in RESTful web services or applications where different segments represent different aspects of the resource or action being addressed.

### Return Value
- The function returns a `string` representing the constructed URL path. The structure of this string is based on the merged parameters and follows the format described above.

### Usage
This function can be used in a web application to dynamically update routes or API endpoints based on user interactions or application state changes. For example, if a user changes the `mode` from "view" to "edit", this function can generate the new URL path reflecting that change seamlessly.

### Example
```javascript
const current = {
  mode: 'map',
  when: '2021',
  axis: 'x',
  quant: 'cases',
  location: 'global'
};

const changes = {
  mode: 'chart',
  location: 'usa'
};

const newUrl = updateUrl(current, changes);
// Result: '/chart/2021/x/cases/usa'
```

## Exports
- `updateUrl`: The function is exported as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

This concise module is designed to provide a quick and efficient way to manage dynamic URL generation, which is a common requirement in modern web development for applications that deal with various states and user interactions.
