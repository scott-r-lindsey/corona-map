	+ This variable's purpose and functionality are unknown, making it a potential source of confusion or bugs in the code.

### Usage

import { home } from './config.js';

Note: The `foo` variable is not recommended for use in production code due to its unclear purpose. It's possible that it was intended as a placeholder or temporary value, but without further context, it's best avoided.
