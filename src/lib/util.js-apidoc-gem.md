### File Documentation: /var/www/html/scott/corona-map/src/util.js

#### Overview
This JavaScript file exports utility functions and constants that may be used throughout the application. Currently, it includes a function to calculate logarithmic midpoints between two values and a constant string.

### Exports

#### 1. `logmidpoints(min, max, steps)`

- **Description**: 
  This function calculates a series of midpoints on a logarithmic scale between a specified minimum (`min`) and maximum (`max`) value. The number of midpoints is determined by the `steps` parameter.

- **Parameters**:
  - `min` (Number): The starting point of the range on a linear scale which will be transformed to a logarithmic scale.
  - `max` (Number): The endpoint of the range on a linear scale which will be transformed to a logarithmic scale.
  - `steps` (Number): The number of intervals or steps between `min` and `max`. This determines how many points will be calculated on the logarithmic scale.

- **Returns**:
  - `Array<Number>`: An array of numbers representing the calculated midpoints on a logarithmic scale between `min` and `max`.

- **Logic Explanation**:
  1. An empty array `points` is initialized to store the calculated midpoints.
  2. The logarithm (natural log) of the `max` value is calculated and adjusted by a fudge factor of 0.9. This adjustment effectively reduces the `logmax` value slightly, possibly for visual or functional tuning.
  3. The logarithm of the `min` value is calculated and stored in `logmin`.
  4. A loop iterates from `logmin` to `logmax`, incrementing by an interval determined by dividing the total logarithmic range (`logmax - logmin`) by `steps`.
  5. Inside the loop, each logarithmic value `v` is transformed back to a linear scale using the exponential function `Math.exp(v)` and pushed into the `points` array.
  6. The resulting array `points` is returned, containing all the calculated midpoints.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```javascript
  const midpoints = logmidpoints(1, 100, 5);
  console.log(midpoints);
  // This will output an array of 5 midpoints on a logarithmic scale between 1 and 100.
  ```

#### 2. `foo`

- **Description**: 
  A simple constant string export. It may be used as a placeholder or for testing purposes in the application.

- **Type**:
  - `String`

- **Value**:
  - `'foo'`

- **Example Usage**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(foo); // Outputs: 'foo'
  ```

### Summary
The `util.js` file provides a function `logmidpoints` which is useful for generating logarithmically spaced values between two numbers. This can be particularly handy in applications involving scientific data visualization where logarithmic scales are common. The `foo` constant serves as a placeholder or simple export, illustrating how constants can be managed in the module.
