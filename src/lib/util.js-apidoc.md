# Detailed Documentation for `util.js`

## Overview
This file contains utility functions that are used in other parts of the application. It includes functions for generating logarithmically spaced midpoints and a simple constant export.

## Functions

### `logmidpoints(min, max, steps)`
Generates an array of points that are logarithmically spaced between the given `min` and `max` values. This can be useful for applications that need to handle data spanning multiple orders of magnitude, such as visualizations of data in a logarithmic scale.

#### Parameters
- `min` (number): The minimum value for the range.
- `max` (number): The maximum value for the range.
- `steps` (number): The number of steps or intervals between the `min` and `max` values.

#### Returns
- `points` (number[]): An array containing the logarithmically spaced points.

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - `points` is initialized as an empty array to store the resulting points.
   - `logmax` is calculated as `Math.log(max) * 0.9`. The multiplication by `0.9` acts as a fudge factor to slightly adjust the maximum logarithmic value. This could be useful for fine-tuning the distribution of points.
   - `logmin` is calculated as `Math.log(min)` to get the logarithm of the minimum value.

2. **Loop to Generate Points**:
   - A `for` loop is used to iterate from `logmin` to `logmax` in steps of `(logmax - logmin) / steps`.
   - For each iteration, the exponential of the current value `v` is calculated using `Math.exp(v)` and pushed into the `points` array. This converts the logarithmic value back into its original scale.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The array `points` containing the logarithmically spaced values is returned.

#### Example Usage
```javascript
const midpoints = logmidpoints(1, 1000, 10);
console.log(midpoints);
// Output: Array of 10 logarithmically spaced points between 1 and 1000
```

### `foo`
A simple constant export of the string `'foo'`.

#### Type
- `foo` (string): A constant string with the value `'foo'`.

#### Detailed Explanation
- This is a straightforward export of a constant value. It might be used as a placeholder or for testing purposes in other parts of the application.

#### Example Usage
```javascript
import { foo } from './util';
console.log(foo); // Output: 'foo'
```

## Summary
- The `logmidpoints` function is designed to generate logarithmically spaced points between a specified minimum and maximum value, with a certain number of steps.
- The `foo` constant is a simple string export with the value `'foo'`. 

Both of these exports can be useful in different contexts within an application, especially for data visualization and testing purposes.
