## File: mapUrl.js

### Overview
This JavaScript file defines a single function, `updateUrl`, which is responsible for constructing a URL path based on the current state and a set of changes. The function is then exported as the default export of the module.

### Function: updateUrl

#### Description
The `updateUrl` function takes two parameters: `current` and `changes`. It merges these two objects to form an updated state and then constructs a URL path string based on specific properties from the updated state.

#### Parameters
- **current** (Object): The current state object that contains key-value pairs representing the current state.
- **changes** (Object): An object containing key-value pairs that represent the changes to be applied to the current state.

#### Returns
- **String**: A URL path string constructed from the merged state.

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Merging Current State and Changes**:
    - The function uses the spread operator (`...`) to merge the `current` and `changes` objects into a new object called `update`. This results in an object that contains all the properties of `current` with any overlapping properties from `changes` taking precedence.
    ```javascript
    const update = { ...current, ...changes };
    ```

2. **Destructuring Properties**:
    - The function then destructures specific properties (`mode`, `when`, `axis`, `quant`, and `location`) from the `update` object. These properties are expected to be present in the `update` object.
    ```javascript
    const {
      mode, when, axis, quant, location,
    } = update;
    ```

3. **Constructing the URL Path**:
    - Finally, the function constructs a URL path string using template literals. The URL path is formed by concatenating the destructured properties, separated by slashes (`/`).
    ```javascript
    return `/${mode}/${when}/${axis}/${quant}/${location}`;
    ```

#### Example Usage
Hereâ€™s an example of how the `updateUrl` function can be used:
```javascript
const currentState = {
  mode: 'view',
  when: '2023-10-01',
  axis: 'x',
  quant: 'cases',
  location: 'NY'
};

const changes = {
  when: '2023-11-01',
  location: 'CA'
};

const newUrl = updateUrl(currentState, changes);
console.log(newUrl); // Output: /view/2023-11-01/x/cases/CA
```
In this example, the `currentState` and `changes` objects are merged, resulting in the URL path `/view/2023-11-01/x/cases/CA`.

### Export
- The `updateUrl` function is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for import in other modules.
```javascript
export default updateUrl;
```

### Summary
The `mapUrl.js` file provides a utility function `updateUrl` for constructing dynamic URL paths based on a combination of a current state and a set of changes. This function is particularly useful for applications that need to update URLs based on user interactions or changes in application state.
