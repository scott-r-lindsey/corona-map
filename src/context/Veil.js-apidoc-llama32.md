**Veil.js Documentation**
=======================

### Overview

This JavaScript file defines a React context API component, `VeilContext`, used to manage the state of a "veil" effect on a map.

### Importing Dependencies

```javascript
import React from 'react';
```

The file imports React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### Defining the Veil Context

```javascript
const VeilContext = React.createContext({
  veil: false,
  setVeil: (veil: boolean) => { },
});
```

The `VeilContext` is created using the `React.createContext()` method. This method returns a new context object, which contains two properties:

*   **`veil`**: A boolean indicating whether the veil effect is enabled or not.
*   **`setVeil`**: A function that allows updating the `veil` state.

The initial state of the context is set to `{ veil: false }`, with the veil effect disabled by default.

### Exporting the Veil Context

```javascript
export default VeilContext;
```

The `VeilContext` component is exported as the default export of this file, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

### Usage

To use the `VeilContext`, you would typically wrap your map component with a `VeilProvider` component, which wraps the context provider:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { VeilContext } from './Veil.js';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <React.StrictMode>
      <VeilProvider>
        {/* Your map component goes here */}
      </VeilProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>
  );
};
```

Then, you can access the veil state and update it using the `useContext` hook:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { VeilContext } from './Veil.js';

const Map = () => {
  const { veil, setVeil } = React.useContext(VeilContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setVeil(!veil)}>Toggle Veil</button>
      {veil ? 'Veil is on' : 'Veil is off'}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Key Logic

The key logic in this file revolves around the `setVeil` function, which updates the `veil` state. When called with a new boolean value, it sets the `veil` state to that value.

This allows you to control the veil effect using React's context API, making it easy to share and manage state between components without passing props down manually.
