# File Documentation: Scale.js

This file defines a React component named `Scale` that is used to render a color scale for a map, likely representing data such as COVID-19 cases in a visualized format. It adjusts the scale based on the device width (mobile vs. desktop) and the type of data being represented (`total` or `percap`).

## Imports

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the `Scale` component.
  
- **logmidpoints**: A utility function imported from `../../lib/util`. This function is likely used to calculate logarithmic midpoints for the scale values.
  
- **withWidth**: A higher-order component from `@material-ui/core` that provides the current width of the viewport to the component, aiding in responsive design.
  
- **abbreviateNumber**: A utility function imported from `../../lib/getMapValue`. This function is likely used to abbreviate large numbers into a more readable format, such as converting 1,000 to 1K.
  
- **useParams**: A hook from `react-router-dom` that provides access to URL parameters, used here to determine the context (`total` or `percap`) for data representation.
  
- **PropTypes** and **exact**: Libraries used for type-checking React component props, ensuring that the `Scale` component receives the correct types of props.

## Component: Scale

### Props

The `Scale` component accepts the following props, which are validated using PropTypes:

- **max**: A required number representing the maximum value on the scale.
  
- **zeroColor**: A required string that indicates the color to be used for the zero value on the scale.
  
- **colorScale**: A required function that determines the color for a given value on the scale.
  
- **width**: A required string representing the width of the viewport, used to determine if the view is on mobile.

### Logic and Functions

1. **Device Responsiveness**: 
   - The `mobile` constant determines if the device is considered mobile based on the `width` prop using a regular expression to test for 'xs'.

2. **Scale Points**:
   - The `points` variable is set to 3 for mobile devices and 4 for others, indicating how many points should be shown on the scale.

3. **Data Context**:
   - The `quant` variable is obtained from URL parameters using the `useParams` hook. It is used to determine the type of data representation (`total` or `percap`).

4. **Rounding Functions**:
   - `round`: Rounds values to the nearest integer if `quant` is 'total'.
   - `roundFour`: Rounds values to two decimal places.
   - `roundEight`: Rounds values to six decimal places.

5. **Minimum Value Determination**:
   - Sets `min` to 1 for 'total' and 0.00001 for 'percap'. The default case leaves `min` undefined, suggesting that logic could be added for additional cases.

6. **Number Formatting**:
   - `formatScaleNumber`: Formats numbers based on the `quant` value and whether the view is mobile:
     - For `percap`, it adds '/M' for very small values and '/K' for others.
     - For `total`, it abbreviates numbers if on mobile.

7. **Calculate Scale Values**:
   - Uses `logmidpoints` to calculate a series of logarithmic midpoints between `min` and `max`, adjusted for `points`.
   - Adds zero to the beginning of the `values` array.

### Rendering

- The component returns a `div` with the class `map-scale`.
- It maps over `values` to produce a series of `div` elements:
  - If the value is 0, it uses `zeroColor`.
  - For other values, it applies `colorScale` to determine the background color and uses `formatScaleNumber` to format the value for display.
  
- Each `div` is a visual representation of a point on the scale.

### Export

- The component is exported wrapped in `withWidth()`, ensuring it receives the current viewport width as a prop.

This component is a critical part of a map visualization tool, dynamically adjusting the scale of data visualization based on device type and data context, offering a responsive and context-aware user experience.
