**CopyFooter.jsx Documentation**
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

The `CopyFooter` component is a functional React component that renders the footer of the application, including links to the privacy policy and terms of service.

**Import Statement**
--------------------

```jsx
import React from 'react';
```

*   This line imports the `React` library, which is required for building user interfaces in React applications.

**CopyFooter Component**
-------------------------

### Functionality

The `CopyFooter` component renders a simple footer with links to the privacy policy and terms of service. It includes copyright information at the bottom.

### Code Breakdown

```jsx
const CopyFooter = () => (
  <div className="footer">
    <a href="/blog/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>
      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;
    <a href="/blog/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>
    <br />
      Copyright &copy; Scott Lindsey
  </div>
);
```

*   The `CopyFooter` component is defined as a functional component using the arrow function syntax.
*   Inside the component, a `div` element with a class name of "footer" is created. This element will serve as the container for the footer content.
*   Two `a` elements are used to create links to the privacy policy and terms of service pages. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of each page, and the text within the `a` element serves as the link label.
*   The `&nbsp;` characters are used to add spacing between the two links, but they do not serve any specific purpose in this context (they might be intended for future use).
*   A `br>` element is used to create a line break after the links, separating them from the copyright information.
*   Finally, the "Copyright &copy; Scott Lindsey" text is rendered, which includes the year of copyright.

**Export Statement**
---------------------

```jsx
export default CopyFooter;
```

*   This line exports the `CopyFooter` component as the default export of the file, making it available for import in other parts of the application.
*   The `default` keyword specifies that this is the primary export of the file.

**Best Practices and Suggestions**
-----------------------------------

*   Consider adding a more semantically accurate class name to the footer element, such as "copyright" or "footer-info".
*   You might want to add some basic accessibility features, such as alt text for the links or a description attribute.
*   If you plan to expand the component to include additional links or content, consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to simplify styling and layout.
