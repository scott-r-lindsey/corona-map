**File Documentation: BottomAdMd.jsx**
=====================================

**Overview**
-----------

This is a React functional component named `BottomAdMd`. It is responsible for rendering an advertisement element at the bottom of its parent container.

**Imports**
------------

The following imports are used in this component:

*   `React` from `react`: This is the main library for building React applications.
*   `PropTypes` from `prop-types`: This library provides a way to validate the types of props passed to components.
*   `exact` from `prop-types-exact`: This function creates an exact prop type definition, which means that any props passed must match exactly with the defined schema.

**Component Definition**
----------------------

```jsx
const BottomAdMd = (props) => {
    const { adHeight, children } = props;

    return (
        <div className="bottom-ad-md">
            <div
                className="bottom-ad"
                style={{ color: 'white', height: `${adHeight}px`, width: '100%' }}
            >
                {children}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};
```

**Key Logic**
-------------

This component takes two required props:

*   `adHeight`: A number representing the height of the advertisement in pixels.
*   `children`: An element that will be rendered inside the advertisement.

The component uses these props to render a container with a specific style. The `style` attribute is used to set the color and height of the container, while the `className` attribute is used to apply CSS classes for styling purposes.

**Export**
---------

```jsx
export default BottomAdMd;
```

This line exports the `BottomAdMd` component as the default export of the file, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

**Type Prop Validation**
----------------------

The following type prop validation is defined using the `exact` function:

```jsx
BottomAdMd.propTypes = exact({
    children: PropTypes.element.isRequired,
    adHeight: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
});
```

This ensures that any props passed to the `BottomAdMd` component must match exactly with the following schema:

*   `children`: An element (i.e., a React node).
*   `adHeight`: A number.

**PropTypes Validation**
------------------------

The `required` keyword is used in the prop type validation to indicate that these props are required. If any of these props are missing, a warning will be displayed in the console indicating that the component requires the specified props.

By including this documentation, it's clear what each part of the code does and how it interacts with other components. This makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase.
