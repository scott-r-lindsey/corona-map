# TrackedRoute.jsx

## Description

The `TrackedRoute` component is a specialized React component that wraps around the standard `Route` component from `react-router-dom`. It integrates Google Analytics tracking to log page views whenever the route changes. This component is particularly useful in single-page applications (SPAs) where route changes do not trigger full page reloads, and thus manual tracking is required to monitor page views.

## Dependencies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: Provides navigational components for React applications.
- **ReactGA**: A library for integrating Google Analytics with React applications.
- **PropTypes**: A runtime type checking tool for React props.
- **PropTypes-exact**: An extension of PropTypes to ensure only the declared props are passed to a component.

## Component: TrackedRoute

### Props

- **location**: An object representing the current location. It contains information such as `pathname` which is used for tracking the current page.
- **computedMatch**: An object containing information about how a `<Route>` matches the URL.
- **path (required)**: A string representing the path pattern to match the route.
- **children (required)**: A React element that represents the child components to render when the route matches.

### Default Props

- **location**: Defaults to an empty object `{}`.
- **computedMatch**: Defaults to an empty object `{}`.

### PropTypes

The component uses `prop-types-exact` to enforce strict typing and ensure that only the specified props are passed.

```javascript
TrackedRoute.propTypes = exact({
  location: PropTypes.object,
  computedMatch: PropTypes.object,
  path: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  children: PropTypes.element.isRequired,
});
```

### Logic and Functionality

- **useEffect Hook**: The component utilizes the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects in function components. In this case, it's used to trigger Google Analytics tracking whenever the `location.pathname` changes.

  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    // disable the analytics during tests
    if (!global.test) {
      const page = location.pathname;

      ReactGA.set({ page });
      ReactGA.pageview(page);
    }
  }, [location.pathname]);
  ```

  - **Condition**: The analytics tracking is disabled during testing by checking `if (!global.test)`.
  - **Tracking**: The `ReactGA.set` method is used to set the current page, and `ReactGA.pageview` logs a page view to Google Analytics.

- **Route Component**: The `TrackedRoute` component returns a `Route` component from `react-router-dom`, using JSX spread attributes to pass all received props down to the `Route`.

  ```javascript
  return (
    <Route {...props} />
  );
  ```

  The spread operator (`...props`) is used here to forward all props to the `Route` component, ensuring that it behaves like a standard route.

### Export

The component is exported as the default export, allowing it to be easily imported and used in other parts of the application.

```javascript
export default TrackedRoute;
```

## Summary

The `TrackedRoute` component is a convenient wrapper around `Route` that automatically tracks page views with Google Analytics whenever the route's pathname changes. This is useful in SPAs for maintaining accurate analytics data. The component is configurable via props, with strict prop type checking enforced using `prop-types-exact`.
