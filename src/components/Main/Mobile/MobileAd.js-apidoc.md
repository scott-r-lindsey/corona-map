# MobileAd.js Documentation

## Overview

This file contains the implementation of a React component called `MobileAd`. The component is designed to display an advertisement on mobile devices with a dismiss button. The dismiss button hides the advertisement when clicked.

## Imports

The file imports necessary modules and components:

1. `React` and `useRef` from 'react': 
   - `React` is the core library for building UI components.
   - `useRef` is a hook that creates a reference to a DOM element.

2. `CloseIcon` from '@material-ui/icons/Close':
   - This is a Material-UI icon component used for the dismiss button.

3. `PropTypes` and `exact` from 'prop-types':
   - `PropTypes` is used for type-checking the props passed to the component.
   - `exact` ensures that only the specified props are passed to the component, and no extra props are allowed.

## MobileAd Component

### Function Definition

```javascript
const MobileAd = (props) => {
```
The `MobileAd` component is defined as a functional component. It accepts `props` as its argument, which contains the properties passed to the component.

### Destructuring Props

```javascript
  const {adHeight} = props;
```
`adHeight` is extracted from `props`. This property determines the height of the advertisement.

### Refs Initialization

```javascript
  const adShellRef = useRef(null);
  const dismissRef = useRef(null);
```
Two refs are created using the `useRef` hook:
- `adShellRef`: References the advertisement container.
- `dismissRef`: References the dismiss button container.

### handleDismissClick Function

```javascript
  const handleDismissClick = () => {
    adShellRef.current.style.display = 'none';
    dismissRef.current.style.display = 'none';
  }
```
This function is triggered when the dismiss button is clicked. It hides both the advertisement and the dismiss button by setting their `display` style to 'none'.

### Return Statement

```javascript
  return (
    <>
      <div className={"mobile-ad-dismiss"} onClick={handleDismissClick} ref={dismissRef}>
        <CloseIcon color={"primary"} />
      </div>
      <div className={"mobile-ad"} style={{color: 'white', height:adHeight+'px'}} ref={adShellRef}>
        { props.children }
      </div>
    </>
  );
```
The component returns a fragment (`<>...</>`) containing two `div` elements:
1. **Dismiss Button Container**:
   - CSS class: `mobile-ad-dismiss`
   - Event: `onClick` triggers `handleDismissClick`
   - Reference: `dismissRef`
   - Contains: `CloseIcon` with primary color.
   
2. **Advertisement Container**:
   - CSS class: `mobile-ad`
   - Inline style: Sets the text color to white and height to the value of `adHeight` in pixels.
   - Reference: `adShellRef`
   - Contains: `props.children` (any child elements passed to the `MobileAd` component).

### PropTypes

```javascript
MobileAd.propTypes = exact({
  adHeight: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
  children: PropTypes.element.isRequired
});
```
PropTypes are defined to enforce type-checking on the props:
- `adHeight`: Must be a number and is required.
- `children`: Must be a React element and is required.

The `exact` function ensures that no additional props are passed to the component beyond `adHeight` and `children`.

### Export

```javascript
export default MobileAd;
```
The `MobileAd` component is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for import in other parts of the application.

## Summary

The `MobileAd` component is a functional React component that displays an advertisement with a dismiss button. It uses refs to manage DOM elements and PropTypes for type-checking. The component ensures a seamless user experience by allowing users to hide the advertisement when needed.
