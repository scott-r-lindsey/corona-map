**DrawerContent.js**
====================================

**Overview**

This JavaScript file defines a React component named `DrawerContent`. It is used to render a drawer content section that contains a logo, navigation menu, and footer information.

**Imports**

The following imports are made from external libraries:

*   `React` from the `react` library, which provides the functionality for building user interfaces.
*   `Logo` from `../../Logo`, which represents the logo image to be displayed in the drawer content section.
*   `MenuItem` and `MenuList` from `@material-ui/core`, which provide components for creating a navigation menu.

**DrawerContent Component**

The `DrawerContent` component is a functional React component that returns JSX elements to render the drawer content.

```javascript
const DrawerContent = () => {
  return (
    <div className={"drawer-content"}>
      {/* Display the logo */}
      <Logo />

      {/* Navigation menu */}
      <MenuList>
        {/* Menu items with links to different pages */}
        <MenuItem>
          <a href="/blog/2020/04/12/about/">About</a>
        </MenuItem>
        <MenuItem>
          <a href="/blog/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>
        </MenuItem>
        <MenuItem>
          <a href="/blog/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>
        </MenuItem>
      </MenuList>

      {/* Footer information */}
      <div className={"footer"}>
        Copyright &copy; Scott Lindsey
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Key Features**

*   The component uses a `MenuList` to display navigation menu items with links to different pages.
*   Each menu item is represented by a `MenuItem` component, which contains an anchor element (`<a>`) that links to the target page.
*   The footer information is displayed using a simple `<div>` element with a CSS class of "footer".

**CSS Classes**

The following CSS classes are used in this component:

*   `drawer-content`: A CSS class applied to the outermost `div` element, which serves as the container for the drawer content.
*   `Logo`: A CSS class applied to the `Logo` component, which displays the logo image.

**Export**

The `DrawerContent` component is exported as a default export of the file:

```javascript
export default DrawerContent;
```

This allows other files to import and use this component in their own code.
