**MobileAd.js**
================

A reusable React component for displaying mobile advertisements.

### Overview

The `MobileAd` component is designed to be used as a self-contained advertisement shell on a mobile device. It takes an optional `adHeight` prop to set the height of the advertisement, and requires a valid `children` prop containing the advertisement content.

### Import Statements

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import CloseIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Close';
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
import exact from 'prop-types-exact';
```

*   `React` and `useRef` are imported for creating a functional component that utilizes the `useRef` hook to manage references to DOM elements.
*   `CloseIcon` is imported from Material-UI for use as the icon on the dismiss button.
*   `PropTypes` and `exact` are imported for validating props using strict typing.

### MobileAd Component

```javascript
const MobileAd = (props) => {
  // Extract adHeight and adShellRef properties from props
  const { adHeight } = props;
  const adShellRef = useRef(null);
  const dismissRef = useRef(null);

  /**
   * Handles the click event on the dismiss button.
   */
  const handleDismissClick = () => {
    // Hide both the advertisement shell and the dismiss button by setting their display styles to 'none'
    adShellRef.current.style.display = 'none';
    dismissRef.current.style.display = 'none';
  }

  return (
    <>
      {/* The dismiss button is rendered as a Material-UI CloseIcon */}
      <div className={"mobile-ad-dismiss"} onClick={handleDismissClick} ref={dismissRef}>
        <CloseIcon color={"primary"} />
      </div>
      {/* The advertisement shell element is rendered with a static height set via the adHeight prop */}
      <div className={"mobile-ad"} style={{ color: 'white', height: adHeight + 'px' }} ref={adShellRef}>
        {/* The advertisement content is passed as children to this component */}
        {props.children}
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
```

### Prop Types

```javascript
MobileAd.propTypes = exact({
  adHeight: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
  children: PropTypes.element.isRequired
});
```

*   `adHeight` must be a valid number and is required for the component to function correctly.
*   `children` must be a valid React element and is required as it contains the advertisement content.

### Export Statement

```javascript
export default MobileAd;
```

The `MobileAd` component is exported as the default export of this module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
