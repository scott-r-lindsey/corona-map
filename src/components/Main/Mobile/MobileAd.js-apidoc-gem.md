# MobileAd.js Documentation

The `MobileAd.js` file is a React component designed to render a mobile advertisement with a dismissible feature. This component is part of a larger application, likely related to displaying ads for mobile users in a web interface. Below is a detailed explanation of the code, its functions, and its logic.

## Imports

```javascript
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import CloseIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Close';
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
import exact from 'prop-types-exact';
```

- **React and useRef:** The component uses React to create and manage the user interface. The `useRef` hook is used to maintain mutable references to DOM elements, which is useful for directly manipulating the DOM.
- **CloseIcon:** This is an icon component from the Material-UI library, representing a close or dismiss action.
- **PropTypes:** This library is used for type-checking props passed to the component, ensuring they meet the specified requirements.
- **exact:** This utility from `prop-types-exact` ensures that the props object has exactly the specified properties and no more.

## MobileAd Component

```javascript
const MobileAd = (props) => {
```

The `MobileAd` component is a functional React component that takes `props` as its parameter. It is responsible for rendering an advertisement with a dismiss button.

### Props

- **adHeight:** A required prop that specifies the height of the ad in pixels. It is a number.
- **children:** A required prop that expects a single React element, which represents the content of the ad.

### Internal Logic

```javascript
const adShellRef = useRef(null);
const dismissRef = useRef(null);
```

- **adShellRef:** A reference to the main ad container. It allows direct manipulation of the ad's DOM node.
- **dismissRef:** A reference to the dismiss button's container, enabling direct DOM manipulation when the ad is dismissed.

### Event Handlers

```javascript
const handleDismissClick = () => {
  adShellRef.current.style.display = 'none';
  dismissRef.current.style.display = 'none';
}
```

- **handleDismissClick:** This function is triggered when the dismiss button is clicked. It sets the `display` style of both the ad container and the dismiss button to `'none'`, effectively hiding them from the view.

### Render Method

```javascript
return (
  <>
    <div className={"mobile-ad-dismiss"} onClick={handleDismissClick} ref={dismissRef}>
      <CloseIcon color={"primary"} />
    </div>
    <div className={"mobile-ad"} style={{color: 'white', height: adHeight + 'px'}} ref={adShellRef}>
      { props.children }
    </div>
  </>
);
```

- **Dismiss Button:** A `div` with a class of `"mobile-ad-dismiss"` that contains the `CloseIcon`. Clicking this button will trigger the `handleDismissClick` function.
- **Ad Container:** A `div` with a class of `"mobile-ad"` that displays the ad content. It applies a `height` style based on the `adHeight` prop and sets the text color to white. The content of this container is provided via the `children` prop.

## Prop Types Validation

```javascript
MobileAd.propTypes = exact({
  adHeight: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
  children: PropTypes.element.isRequired
});
```

- **propTypes:** Defines the expected types and requirements for the component's props.
  - `adHeight`: Must be a number and is required.
  - `children`: Must be a single React element and is required.
- **exact:** Ensures that no additional props are passed to the component beyond what is specified.

## Export

```javascript
export default MobileAd;
```

- **Default Export:** The component is exported as the default export, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

In summary, the `MobileAd` component provides a simple and interactive advertisement block for mobile interfaces, complete with a dismiss functionality to enhance user experience. It leverages React's hooks and Material-UI's icon library to build a modern and responsive UI component.
