# Documentation for DrawerContent.js

This file defines a React functional component named `DrawerContent`. It is used to render the content inside a drawer component, typically used in a sidebar navigation layout. The component includes a logo, a menu list with links to various pages, and a footer with copyright information.

## Imports

1. **React**: 
   - The base library for building user interfaces in a declarative manner. 
   - `React` is imported to use JSX syntax and React components.

2. **Logo**:
   - A custom component located at `../../Logo`.
   - This component is likely used to render a company or application logo at the top of the drawer content.

3. **MenuItem and MenuList** from `@material-ui/core`:
   - **MenuItem**: A component from Material-UI that represents an individual item in a menu.
   - **MenuList**: A component from Material-UI that acts as a container for `MenuItem` components.
   - These components are used to create a structured list of navigational items within the drawer.

## Component: DrawerContent

- **Type**: Functional Component
- **Purpose**: To render the contents of a navigation drawer, which includes a logo, a list of menu items, and a footer.

### JSX Structure

1. **Root Element**: 
   - `<div className={"drawer-content"}>`: 
     - A `div` element with the class `drawer-content`, presumably styled via CSS to fit within a drawer layout.

2. **Logo**:
   - `<Logo />`: 
     - Renders the `Logo` component. This is typically used to display the application's logo, providing brand identity at the top of the drawer.

3. **MenuList**:
   - `<MenuList>`: 
     - Wraps the list of menu items. This component provides the structure for the menu and is styled according to Material-UI's standards.

4. **MenuItems**:
   - Each `<MenuItem>` contains an anchor (`<a>`) tag linking to different pages within the application. These links are:
     - **About**: Links to `/blog/2020/04/12/about/`.
     - **Privacy Policy**: Links to `/blog/privacy-policy/`.
     - **Terms of Service**: Links to `/blog/terms-of-service/`.
   - These menu items provide navigation for users to access important information about the site and its policies.

5. **Footer**:
   - `<div className={"footer"}>`: 
     - Contains the copyright notice.
     - Styled with a class `footer` for consistent appearance.
     - Displays "Copyright Â© Scott Lindsey" indicating ownership and possibly the creator of the content.

### Export

- `export default DrawerContent;`
  - This line exports the `DrawerContent` component as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

### Additional Notes

- **Styling**: The component relies on CSS classes (`drawer-content` and `footer`) for its styling. These styles are not defined within this file, suggesting they are managed in external CSS files.
- **Material-UI**: The use of Material-UI components implies a design language consistent with Material Design, ensuring the app has a modern and usable interface.
- **Links**: The hardcoded paths in the anchors suggest that these are static links, possibly leading to important pages that are less likely to change frequently.
