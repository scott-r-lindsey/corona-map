This file contains the implementation of the `MobileMain` component using React. It is part of a larger application, likely a web-based map visualization tool for tracking data related to "corona", possibly COVID-19. The component utilizes several libraries and custom components to render a mobile-friendly interface with interactive elements.

## Imports

- **React and Hooks**: The file imports `React` along with the `useState` hook for managing component state.
- **Material-UI Components**:
  - `Drawer` and `IconButton`: Used for creating a swipeable drawer interface and a button for toggling it.
  - `MenuIcon`: An icon component to represent a menu.
- **Custom Utility Functions**:
  - `getMaxValueForAxis` and `getTrimmedData`: Functions for data processing, imported from a library located at `../../../lib/getMapValue`.
- **Custom Components**:
  - `Map`, `MapSlider`, `MapWidgets`: Components related to map visualization, imported from the `../../Map/` directory.
  - `MobileAd`, `AmznSearchAd`, `MobileInfo`, `Text`, `DrawerContent`: Other UI components used within this component.
- **React Router**: `useParams` is imported to access URL parameters.
- **PropTypes**: Used to validate the props passed to the component.
- `exact`: A utility from `prop-types-exact` to enforce strict prop validation.

## Component: MobileMain

`MobileMain` is a functional component that is responsible for rendering the main interface for the mobile version of the application. It utilizes hooks and UI components to create an interactive user experience.

### Props

- `data` (Object): The data to be visualized, required.
- `axis` (String): Specifies the axis for data representation, required.
- `when` (String): A time-based parameter for filtering data, required.
- `colorScale` (Function): A function that determines the color scale for the map visualization, required.

### State

- `drawerOpen` (Boolean): A state variable that tracks whether the drawer is open or closed. Initialized to `false`.

### Hooks

- `useParams`: Used to extract the `quant` parameter from the URL, which is used to adjust the axis value.

### Event Handlers

- `handleMenuClick`: Toggles the `drawerOpen` state, effectively opening or closing the drawer.
- `handleMenuDrawerClose`: Sets `drawerOpen` to `false`, closing the drawer.
- `handleMenuDrawerOpen`: A placeholder function intended for future use when the drawer is opened.

### Key Logic

1. **Data Processing**:
   - `max`: Calculated by `getMaxValueForAxis`, this value is used to determine the maximum value for the current axis and quant combination.
   - `trimmedData`: Derived from `getTrimmedData`, this data is filtered based on the `when` parameter.

2. **Rendering**:
   - **Drawer**: A swipeable drawer is rendered on the right side. It contains the `DrawerContent` component.
   - **Menu Button**: An icon button with a `MenuIcon` is provided to toggle the drawer.
   - **Content**: The main panel includes:
     - `MobileInfo`: Displays information derived from `trimmedData`.
     - **Map and Widgets**: The `Map`, `MapWidgets`, and `MapSlider` components are used to render the interactive map and associated controls.
     - `Text`: Additional textual information or UI elements.
   - **Advertisements**:
     - `MobileAd` and `AmznSearchAd`: These components render advertisements, utilizing `data.searchVals` for Amazon search ads.

### PropTypes

`MobileMain` uses `propTypes` with `exact` to enforce strict validation of its props, ensuring that only expected props are passed and utilized.

## Export

- The `MobileMain` component is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

This component is a crucial part of the mobile user experience, tying together data visualization and interactive UI elements to provide users with a comprehensive and responsive application interface.
