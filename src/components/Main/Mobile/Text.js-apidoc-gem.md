# File: `Text.js`

## Overview

The `Text.js` file is a React component designed to display informational text related to COVID-19. It provides details about data sources, site functionality, and health precautions. The component also includes a footer section imported from another module.

## Dependencies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create the `Text` component.
- **react-router-dom**: Provides navigation components for React applications. The `Link` component from this library is used to navigate to different routes within the application.
- **CopyFooter**: A custom footer component imported from `../../CopyFooter`, which is assumed to be another file within the project that provides footer content.

## Component: `Text`

### Description

The `Text` component is a functional component that returns a fragment containing a series of paragraphs. Each paragraph provides different pieces of information related to COVID-19.

### JSX Structure

- **Fragment (`<>` ... `</>`)**: Used to wrap multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
  
- **`div.text-block`**: A container div with the class `text-block`. This class likely styles the text content in the CSS.

  - **Paragraph 1**: 
    - Provides information on where the COVID-19 data is sourced from.
    - Includes a hyperlink to the John Hopkins CSSE website for further data reference.

  - **Paragraph 2**:
    - Explains the bookmarkable nature of the page, allowing users to share specific data.
    - Contains a `Link` component to navigate to a specific route (`/COVID-US/now/deaths/united%20states`) within the application.
  
  - **Paragraph 3**:
    - Lists general health precautions to prevent COVID-19 spread.
    - Provides links to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for more detailed guidance.

  - **Paragraph 4**:
    - Mentions the creator of the site, Scott Lindsey, and provides a link to an "About" page.

- **`CopyFooter` Component**:
  - This component is inserted at the end of the `Text` component's return statement.
  - It is assumed to provide some form of footer content, likely including copyright or additional related information.

### Function Definition

- **`Text` (Function Component)**:
  - **Purpose**: To encapsulate and render informational text related to COVID-19, with links to resources and site features.
  - **Returns**: JSX fragment containing a `div` with multiple paragraphs and a `CopyFooter` component.

### Export

- **`export default Text;`**:
  - Exports the `Text` component as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

## Key Logic

The key logic of the `Text` component revolves around rendering static informational content with embedded links for navigation and external resources. It does not have any state or dynamic behavior, focusing solely on displaying important information to the user. The use of the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` allows for seamless client-side navigation without page reloads.
