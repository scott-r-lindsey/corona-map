## Detailed Documentation

### Import Statements
```javascript
import React from 'react';
```
- **React**: The file imports the React library, which is necessary to create React components. The `React` object is used to access the JSX syntax and other React functionalities.

### CopyFooter Component
```javascript
const CopyFooter = () => (
  <div className="footer">
    <a href="/blog/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>
      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;
    <a href="/blog/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>
    <br />
      Copyright &copy; Scott Lindsey
  </div>
);
```
- **CopyFooter**: This is a functional component defined using an arrow function syntax. Functional components are simpler and more concise than class components, especially when they don't need to manage state or lifecycle methods.
  
- **JSX**: The component returns JSX, which is a syntax extension that looks similar to HTML and is used to describe the UI elements in React. JSX makes it easy to write and understand the structure of the component.

#### Structure and Elements
- `<div className="footer">`: This is a `div` element with a class name of "footer". The class name can be used to apply CSS styles to the footer section.
  
  - `<a href="/blog/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>`: This is an anchor (`<a>`) element that links to the Privacy Policy page of the website. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the Privacy Policy page.
  
  - `&nbsp; &nbsp;`: These are HTML entities for non-breaking spaces. They add space between the two anchor links. Each `&nbsp;` represents one space, so two of them together add two spaces.
  
  - `<a href="/blog/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>`: This is another anchor element that links to the Terms of Service page. Similarly, the `href` attribute points to the URL of the Terms of Service page.
  
  - `<br />`: This is a line break element. It inserts a line break, which means that the text following it will start on a new line.
  
  - `Copyright &copy; Scott Lindsey`: This is a copyright notice. The `&copy;` is an HTML entity that represents the copyright symbol (Â©). The name "Scott Lindsey" indicates the copyright holder.

### Export Statement
```javascript
export default CopyFooter;
```
- **export default**: This statement exports the `CopyFooter` component as the default export of the module. This allows other files to import and use the `CopyFooter` component.

## Summary
The `CopyFooter.jsx` file defines a simple React functional component that renders a footer with links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages, along with a copyright notice. The component is styled using a CSS class named "footer" and uses JSX syntax to structure its content. The component is exported as the default export of the module, making it available for use in other parts of the application.
