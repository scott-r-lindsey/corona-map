## File: /var/www/html/scott/corona-map/src/Logo.jsx

### Overview
This file defines a React functional component named `Logo`. This component is designed to be a part of a web application that potentially deals with information related to the COVID-19 virus. The `Logo` component includes an image and text, both wrapped in a link that directs users to the home page of the application.

### Imports
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { home } from '../lib/config';
```
1. **React**: This import brings in the core React library which is necessary to create React components.
2. **Link**: Imported from `react-router-dom`. This is a specialized component used to create navigational links in a React application that uses React Router for client-side routing.
3. **home**: This is a configuration constant imported from a local configuration file (`../lib/config`). It likely contains the path or URL of the home page to which the link should navigate.

### Component Definition
```javascript
const Logo = () => (
  <div className="logo">
    <Link to={home} className="logo">
      <img src="/img/covid-19-100.png" alt="corona-virus" />
      <span className="logo-text">
          COVID-VIR.US
      </span>
    </Link>
  </div>
);
```

#### Explanation
- **Functional Component**: `Logo` is defined as a functional component, which is a simpler way to create components that only contain a `render` method and do not have their own state.
  
- **JSX Structure**:
  - The component returns a JSX structure that includes a `div` element with a class name of `"logo"`.
  - Inside this `div`, there is a `Link` component from `react-router-dom`:
    - **to={home}**: The `to` attribute specifies the navigation target, which is the value of the `home` constant imported earlier.
    - **className="logo"**: This assigns a CSS class for styling purposes.
  - Inside the `Link` component:
    - **img**: An image element is used to display a logo image.
      - **src="/img/covid-19-100.png"**: The source path of the logo image file.
      - **alt="corona-virus"**: The alt text for the image, used for accessibility and in case the image does not load.
    - **span**: A span element containing the text `COVID-VIR.US`, which is likely the name of the website or application.

### Export
```javascript
export default Logo;
```
- **export default Logo**: This line exports the `Logo` component as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

### Summary
The `Logo.jsx` file defines a simple React component that combines an image and text into a clickable link directing users to the home page of the application. The component makes use of React Router's `Link` component to handle navigation in a React application. The styling and image path are hard-coded, which can be configured as needed for the application's requirements.
