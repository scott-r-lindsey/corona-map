## File Documentation: `AmznSearchAd.js`

This file defines a React functional component named `AmznSearchAd`. The component is designed to render an Amazon search advertisement within a specified area on a webpage. This document provides a detailed description of the code and its functionality, including explanations of key functions, logic, and components.

### Imports

- **React, useEffect, useRef**: 
  - `React` is the core library for building UI components.
  - `useEffect` is a React Hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components.
  - `useRef` is a React Hook that returns a mutable ref object, which can be used to directly access a DOM element.

- **postscribe**: 
  - This library is used for asynchronously writing HTML into the document, allowing scripts to be executed without blocking the browser.

- **PropTypes, exact**:
  - `PropTypes` is a library for type-checking the props passed to a React component.
  - `exact` is a utility that ensures only the specified props can be passed to the component, helping to catch potential errors.

### Component: `AmznSearchAd`

#### Props

The component accepts the following props:

- **`adHeight`**: (Required) A number specifying the height of the advertisement area.
- **`amznAdVals`**: (Required) An object containing Amazon advertisement configuration values.

#### Key Logic

1. **Random Search Term Selection**:
   - The component extracts `terms` from `amznAdVals` and selects a random term to be used in the Amazon search ad. This is done using:
     ```javascript
     const searchTerm = terms[Math.floor(Math.random() * terms.length)];
     ```

2. **Ref Initialization**:
   - `divRef` is initialized using `useRef` to reference the `<div>` where the ad will be injected.

3. **Effect Hook (`useEffect`)**:
   - The `useEffect` hook is used to execute code when the component is mounted or updated.
   - It checks if the global `test` variable is not set, indicating that ads should be shown (typically, this would be disabled during testing environments).
   
4. **Dynamic Script Injection**:
   - If ads are enabled, an HTML script block is dynamically created with Amazon ad configuration values. 
   - The `postscribe` function is used to inject this HTML into the element with `id="bottom-ad"`.

5. **Conditional Ad Injection**:
   - Before injecting the ad script, the code checks if the `divRef.current.innerHTML` is empty. If not, it clears the content to avoid duplicates.

#### Return Statement

- The component returns a `<div>` element with the `id="bottom-ad"`. This element is styled to occupy the full width and a specified height (`adHeight`), and it serves as the container for the Amazon ad.

### Prop Types Definition

- The `propTypes` for `AmznSearchAd` are defined using the `exact` utility to ensure strict prop validation:
  ```javascript
  AmznSearchAd.propTypes = exact({
    amznAdVals: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
    adHeight: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
  });
  ```

### Sample Code Comment

The file contains a commented-out section with sample Amazon ad JavaScript code. This code snippet serves as a reference for the structure and configuration of the Amazon ad script used within the component.

### Summary

This component is responsible for rendering a dynamically configured Amazon search advertisement based on provided properties. It uses `postscribe` for script injection, ensuring that ads do not block the rendering of the page. The component is designed to support testing by allowing ads to be conditionally disabled.
