**CopyFooter.test.jsx**
=====================================

### Overview

This test file verifies that the `CopyFooter` component renders correctly with the expected links and text.

### Import Statements

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import CopyFooter from './CopyFooter';
```

*   `React`: The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   `render` and `screen`: Functions provided by the `@testing-library/react` package to render components in a test environment. `render` is used to render a component tree, while `screen` provides utilities for interacting with the rendered components.

### Test Function

```jsx
test('renders CopyFooter with correct links and text', () => {
  // ...
});
```

*   `test`: A function provided by Jest (a testing framework) that defines a test case.
*   The string passed to the `test` function is the description of the test case.

### Render Function

```jsx
render(<CopyFooter />);
```

*   `render`: A function from the `@testing-library/react` package used to render the `CopyFooter` component in a test environment.

### Assertion Functions

The following assertion functions are used to verify that the expected behavior occurs:

```jsx
expect(privacyLink).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(privacyLink).toHaveAttribute('href', '/blog/privacy-policy/');
```

*   `expect`: A function provided by Jest that is used to assert expectations about the behavior of a component.
*   `toBeInTheDocument`: An assertion function that verifies whether an element with the specified text content exists in the document.
*   `toHaveAttribute`: An assertion function that verifies whether an element has the specified attribute with the expected value.

### Link and Text Verifications

```jsx
// Check for Privacy Policy link
const privacyLink = screen.getByText(/Privacy Policy/i);
expect(privacyLink).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(privacyLink).toHaveAttribute('href', '/blog/privacy-policy/');
```

*   `screen.getByText`: A function that returns the first element in the document with the specified text content.
*   `/Privacy Policy/i`: A regular expression pattern that matches the text "Privacy Policy" (case-insensitive).
*   The verification checks that:
    *   An element with the specified text exists in the document (`toBeInTheDocument`).
    *   The `href` attribute of this element has the expected value (`toHaveAttribute`).

The same logic is applied for the Terms of Service link and copyright text.

### Conclusion

This test file verifies that the `CopyFooter` component renders correctly with the expected links and text, ensuring that the user interface meets the required specifications.
