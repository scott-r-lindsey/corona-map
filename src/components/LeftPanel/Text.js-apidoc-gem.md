# Documentation for Text.js

This file is part of a React application that appears to be related to displaying information about COVID-19 data on a map interface. The primary purpose of this file is to define a React functional component that displays informative text about the COVID-19 data being presented on the application.

## Imports

- `import React from "react";`: This line imports the React library, which is essential for building components in a React application.

- `import { Link } from "react-router-dom";`: This imports the `Link` component from the `react-router-dom` package, which is used for navigation within the application. The `Link` component allows for client-side navigation, which means the application can change views without reloading the page.

## Component Definition

### `Text` Functional Component

The `Text` component is a stateless functional component. It returns a JSX structure that includes multiple paragraphs of text, providing information about the COVID-19 chart, its data sources, user interaction capabilities, and general health advice.

#### JSX Structure

- `<div className="text-block">`: The component returns a `div` element with a class of `text-block`, which is likely styled via CSS elsewhere in the application.

- `<p>` elements: Each paragraph `<p>` element contains informative text.

  - **First Paragraph**: Explains the logarithmic scale of the chart, emphasizing its utility in illustrating the "flattening of the curve" regarding COVID-19 cases.
  
  - **Second Paragraph**: Describes the meaning of the 1x, 2x, and 3x lines on the chart, indicating hypothetical doubling rates.
  
  - **Third Paragraph**: Provides information about the data source, linking to John Hopkins CSSE for users to explore further.

  - **Fourth Paragraph**: Mentions that the page is bookmarkable and includes a `Link` component to navigate back to the United States view of the map. This demonstrates the use of React Router for creating a SPA (Single Page Application) experience.

  - **Fifth Paragraph**: Offers health advice and precautions, linking to authoritative sources like the WHO and CDC for more detailed guidance.

  - **Sixth Paragraph**: Provides a brief mention of the creator of the site, Scott Lindsey, with a link to an "About" page.

## Export

- `export default Text;`: This line exports the `Text` component as the default export from this module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

## Summary

The `Text` component is a straightforward React functional component used to render static informational content on a COVID-19 data visualization page. It combines static text with dynamic navigation links, leveraging the `react-router-dom` library to enhance user interaction and navigation within the application. The component serves as an informational section, providing context, data sources, health advice, and user interaction notes to the users of the application.
