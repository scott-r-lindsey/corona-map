# Documentation for `CopyFooter.jsx`

## Overview

The `CopyFooter.jsx` file defines a simple React functional component named `CopyFooter`. This component renders a footer section typically used in web applications to display links to important legal documents and copyright information. It is a part of a larger application, likely related to a map or data visualization tool, as suggested by its directory path.

## Detailed Explanation

### Import Statement

```jsx
import React from 'react';
```

- **Purpose**: This imports the React library, which is necessary for defining React components. The `React` library is foundational for building components by utilizing JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that allows HTML-like code in JavaScript files.
  
### Functional Component: `CopyFooter`

```jsx
const CopyFooter = () => (
  <div className="footer">
    <a href="/blog/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>
      &nbsp;
      &nbsp;
    <a href="/blog/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>
    <br />
      Copyright &copy; Scott Lindsey
  </div>
);
```

- **Definition**: `CopyFooter` is a stateless functional component. It does not manage state or lifecycle methods, making it simple and efficient for rendering UI elements that do not require state changes or complex logic.
  
- **Return JSX**: The component returns a JSX element, specifically a `<div>` with the class name "footer". Inside this `<div>`, there are:
  
  - **Links**: Two anchor (`<a>`) elements that link to the "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service" pages. This is a common practice in web applications to ensure that users have easy access to legal documents.
  
  - **Non-Breaking Spaces**: `&nbsp;` is used to add space between the two links for better visual separation. This is an HTML entity representing a non-breaking space, ensuring that the spaces are rendered consistently across browsers.
  
  - **Line Break**: A `<br />` element is used to insert a line break between the links and the copyright text, improving readability and layout.
  
  - **Copyright Text**: Displays a copyright statement using the `&copy;` HTML entity to render the copyright symbol (Â©) followed by the author's name, Scott Lindsey.
  
### Export Statement

```jsx
export default CopyFooter;
```

- **Purpose**: This statement exports the `CopyFooter` component as the default export from the module. This allows other files or components within the application to import and use `CopyFooter` easily.
  
## Usage

The `CopyFooter` component can be utilized in other parts of the application to consistently display a footer with privacy and terms links, along with copyright information. It can be included in a parent component by importing it and using it as a JSX tag:

```jsx
import CopyFooter from './CopyFooter';

const SomeComponent = () => (
  <div>
    {/* Other content */}
    <CopyFooter />
  </div>
);
```

## Conclusion

The `CopyFooter.jsx` file provides a straightforward implementation of a footer component using React. It is focused on displaying key legal links and copyright information, which are common requirements for web applications. Its simplicity and use of stateless functional components make it lightweight and easy to maintain.
