# Detailed Documentation for `env.js`

## Overview
The `env.js` file is responsible for managing environment-specific configurations for a web application. This file is particularly useful for setting up different configurations for development and production environments.

## File Structure and Logic

### Configurations for Different Environments

#### Development Configuration (`dev`)

```javascript
const dev = {
  GA_ACCOUNT: 'UA-161846587-2',
};
```
- **`dev` Object**: This object holds configuration values specific to the development environment.
  - **`GA_ACCOUNT`**: This is the Google Analytics account ID used for tracking analytics in the development environment.

#### Production Configuration (`prod`)

```javascript
const prod = {
  GA_ACCOUNT: 'UA-161846587-1',
};
```
- **`prod` Object**: This object holds configuration values specific to the production environment.
  - **`GA_ACCOUNT`**: This is the Google Analytics account ID used for tracking analytics in the production environment.

### Environment Selection Logic

```javascript
const config = process.env.REACT_APP_STAGE === 'prod'
  ? prod
  : dev;
```
- **`config` Variable**: This variable determines which configuration to use based on the environment the application is running in.
  - **Condition**: It checks the value of the environment variable `REACT_APP_STAGE`.
    - If `REACT_APP_STAGE` is set to `'prod'`, the `prod` configuration is selected.
    - Otherwise, the `dev` configuration is selected by default.

### Exported Configuration

```javascript
export default {
  // Add common config values here
  MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE: 5000000,
  ...config,
};
```
- **Default Export Object**: This is the final configuration object that gets exported.
  - **`MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE`**: A common configuration value specifying the maximum size for attachments, set to `5000000` bytes (5 MB).
  - **`...config`**: The spread operator is used to include all properties from the selected configuration (`dev` or `prod`).

## Summary
- The `env.js` file defines two sets of configurations: one for development and one for production.
- Based on the environment variable `REACT_APP_STAGE`, it selects the appropriate configuration.
- It exports a configuration object that includes common settings (like `MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE`) along with the environment-specific settings.
- This structure allows the application to dynamically adjust its behavior based on the environment it is running in, facilitating better development and production practices.

By managing configurations in this way, the application can easily switch between environments without changing the core code, making it more maintainable and scalable.
