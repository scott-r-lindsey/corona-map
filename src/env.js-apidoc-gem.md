# File Documentation: `env.js`

This file defines the configuration settings for a React application, specifically related to environment-dependent configurations. It exports a configuration object that merges common configuration values with environment-specific settings. The file uses JavaScript ES6 module syntax and handles different configurations for development and production stages.

## Contents

1. **Environment-Specific Configurations**
2. **Configuration Selection Logic**
3. **Exported Configuration Object**

### 1. Environment-Specific Configurations

The file begins by defining two JavaScript objects, `dev` and `prod`, which hold configuration values specific to development and production environments, respectively.

- **`dev` Object:**
  ```javascript
  const dev = {
    GA_ACCOUNT: 'UA-161846587-2',
  };
  ```
  - `GA_ACCOUNT`: This property holds the Google Analytics account ID used for tracking in the development environment. The account ID is a unique identifier for the Google Analytics property associated with the development stage.

- **`prod` Object:**
  ```javascript
  const prod = {
    GA_ACCOUNT: 'UA-161846587-1',
  };
  ```
  - `GA_ACCOUNT`: Similar to the development object, this property holds the Google Analytics account ID for production. It is distinct from the development account to ensure that analytics data is accurately separated between environments.

### 2. Configuration Selection Logic

The file contains logic to determine which configuration object should be used based on the current stage of the application. This logic leverages an environment variable, `REACT_APP_STAGE`, to differentiate between development and production environments.

- **Configuration Logic:**
  ```javascript
  const config = process.env.REACT_APP_STAGE === 'prod'
    ? prod
    : dev;
  ```
  - **`process.env.REACT_APP_STAGE`**: This environment variable should be set externally (e.g., through a `.env` file or environment configuration in hosting platforms) to either `'prod'` or another value that indicates a non-production environment.
  - If `REACT_APP_STAGE` equals `'prod'`, the `prod` configuration is selected. Otherwise, the `dev` configuration is chosen by default.

### 3. Exported Configuration Object

The final part of the file exports a single configuration object. This object merges common configuration values with the environment-specific configurations determined by the selection logic.

- **Export Statement:**
  ```javascript
  export default {
    // Add common config values here
    MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE: 5000000,
    ...config,
  };
  ```
  - **`MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE`**: This is a common configuration value, applicable to both environments. It represents the maximum size (in bytes) for file attachments, set to 5,000,000 bytes (approximately 5 MB).
  - **`...config`**: This spread operator syntax is used to include all properties from the selected `config` object (`dev` or `prod`) into the exported configuration object. This means that the exported object will contain both common and environment-specific values.

### Summary

In summary, this `env.js` file is a simple yet effective way to manage environment-based configuration in a React application. It helps in maintaining separate settings for development and production environments, ensuring that certain operations (like analytics tracking) are environment-specific. The use of environment variables allows for dynamic configuration without changing the source code, facilitating more flexible deployments.
