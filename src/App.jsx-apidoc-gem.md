# App.jsx Documentation

This file defines the main component of a React application that displays a corona virus map. The application is styled using Material-UI and custom SCSS, and it utilizes React Router for client-side navigation. Below is a detailed breakdown of the code.

## Imports

- **React, useState, useEffect**: 
  - React is the core library for building user interfaces. 
  - `useState` is a hook that allows you to add state to a functional component.
  - `useEffect` is a hook that performs side effects in function components, such as data fetching.

- **./styles/App.scss**: 
  - This file contains custom styles for the application.

- **ThemeProvider, createMuiTheme**: 
  - These are from Material-UI, a popular React UI framework.
  - `ThemeProvider` allows you to apply a theme to Material-UI components.
  - `createMuiTheme` is used to create a theme object.

- **Redirect, BrowserRouter, Switch**: 
  - These are part of React Router, a library for handling routing in React applications.
  - `Redirect` is used to redirect the user to a different route.
  - `BrowserRouter` is a router implementation for the web.
  - `Switch` renders the first child `Route` or `Redirect` that matches the location.

- **home**: 
  - Imported from `./lib/config`, it presumably contains the default route path.

- **primary, secondary**: 
  - These are imported from `./lib/colors` and are used to define the color palette for the theme.

- **TrackedRoute, RouteValidator**: 
  - These components are custom components defined in the project.
  - `TrackedRoute` likely extends the functionality of a regular route by adding tracking capabilities.
  - `RouteValidator` is a component that validates the route parameters against the data.

- **embellishData**: 
  - A utility function from `./lib/getMapValue` to process data before it is set in the state.

- **Veil, VeilContext**: 
  - `Veil` is a component likely used for displaying a loading or overlay effect.
  - `VeilContext` is a React context used to manage the visibility state of the `Veil`.

- **node-fetch**: 
  - A library for making HTTP requests in Node.js environments, used here for fetching data.

## Constants

- **dataUrl**: 
  - A constant defining the endpoint from which the application fetches its data (`/data/full.json`).

- **breakpoints**: 
  - An object defining custom breakpoint values for responsive design, used in the theme configuration.

- **theme**: 
  - A theme object created using `createMuiTheme` with customized breakpoints and a color palette.

## App Component

### State Management

- **data**: 
  - State holding the fetched data (initially `null`).

- **veil**: 
  - State controlling the visibility of the `Veil` component (initially `false`).

### useEffect

- The `useEffect` hook is used to fetch data asynchronously when the component mounts.
- The data is fetched from `dataUrl` using `node-fetch`.
- Once fetched, the data is parsed to JSON and processed using `embellishData` for both state and county data.
- The processed data is then set into the `data` state.

### Conditional Rendering

- If `data` is available:
  - The app is wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` to apply the theme.
  - A `VeilContext.Provider` is used to provide `veil` state to child components.
  - A `Router` encapsulates a `Switch` component for handling routes.
    - `TrackedRoute` components are used for defining application routes.
    - A specific route with parameters (`/:mode/:when/:axis/:quant/:location`) renders `RouteValidator` with the data.
    - A default route redirects to the `home` path.
  - The `Veil` component is rendered to manage overlay effects.

- If `data` is not available:
  - A full-screen loading animation is displayed with a background color set to `primary`.

## Exports

- **export default App**: 
  - The `App` component is exported as the default export, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

This file sets up the core structure of the application, including routing, theme management, data fetching, and loading states. It utilizes several third-party libraries to streamline these processes and maintain a clean and organized codebase.
